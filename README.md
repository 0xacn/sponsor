## GitHub Sponsors is a hassle to set up for minors, so here's my workaround.

See an example of what it looks like [here](https://sponsor.cnrad.dev).

If you would like to deploy this and accept donations yourself, here's what to do:
- Fork this repository
- Change the `src/info.ts` file (this is where you put your information, such as username, description, featured repos, etc.)
- Deploy (with Vercel, preferably)

Special credit goes to [Eli](https://github.com/hox), for leading me to the idea and giving me the motivation to make it :+1:

As always, feel free to leave a star :star: as it helps a ton, and means a lot. :)
